%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it
% (optional argument typesets an object right-justified across from name
%  as well)
%
% Usage: \makeheading{name}
%        OR
%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picutre}]{Your Name}

\emph{Research Assistant} \hfill Aug. 2010 - Dec. 2014\\

1. Utilizing Microblogs for Automatic News Highlights Generation\\
    \emph{Collaboration project with Qatar Computing Institute of Technology}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: This project aims to use relevant tweets of a news article to help generate better news summary. We proposed three strategies: (1) extract news sentence with the help of relevant tweets; (2) extract tweets as news highlights; (3) use relevant tweets to help select and compress the news sentence as highlights. 
	\item \underline{CORPUS}: We constructed two corpora for evaluation, including CNN news articles and their relevant tweets. One corpus includes human generated summary collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
	\item \underline{PUBLICATION}: COLING2014, SIGIR2015, two papers under review
\end{itemize}

2. Emergent Rumor Detection and Credibility Ranking
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: This project aims to identify rumor events from social media and generate tweets summary for each identified rumor event. We proposed a rumor detection framework considering three factors: (1) text uncertainty, (2) temporal characteristics (3) opinion controversy.
	\item \underline{CORPUS}: We constructed one corpus for rumor detection, including events consisting of related microblogs from a Chinese microblogging website. Human annotations were collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
	\item \underline{PUBLICATION}: ACL2013, two papers under review
\end{itemize}

3. Web Information Mining and Decision Support Platform for the Modern Service Industry
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: This project aims to provide enterprises with the services of retrieving news from websites, extracting commercial information, exploring customers' opinions, and analyzing collaborative/competitive social networks. The core technologies have been applied to the pillar industries of Hong Kong, including innovative finance, modem logistics, information technology, etc. 
	\item \underline{SYSTEM}: \href{http://sepc111.se.cuhk.edu.hk:8080/modest}{[MODEST]} (in Chinese)
	\item \underline{PUBLICATION}: ACL2014
\end{itemize}

4. Microblog Search
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: We proposed to improve microblog search performance from two aspects: (1) utilize external information for pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) ; (2) re-rank search results by combing several state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.  
	\item \sloppypar{\underline{PUBLICATION}: Technical reports on TREC2011, TREC2012, TREC2013, TREC2014 and SoMeRA2015}
	\item \underline{IMPACT}: We participated in microblog track in TREC and won second place for year 2013 and 2014. 
\end{itemize}

5. Social Media Analysis
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: This project aims to investigate the behavior of mainstream media on Twitter and study how they exert their influence to shape public opinion during the UK's 2010 General Election.
	\item \underline{PUBLICATION}: ACM HyperText2013
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Knowledge Media Institute}\\
\emph{Research Associate} \hfill Apr. 2012 - Jun. 2012\\

1. Exploratory Discourse Detection
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.2em
	\item \underline{OVERVIEW}: This project aims to identify exploratory dialogues from online learning material. We proposed a self-training framework to identify exploratory dialogue.
	\item \underline{CORPUS}: We constructed a corpus including online meeting text with human annotations collected from two education experts. The annotation guideline was generated based on collaboration with annotators. 
	\item \underline{SYSTEM}: The technique has been applied to \href{http://sociallearn.open.ac.uk/public}{Social Learn Platform}.
	\item \underline{PUBLICATION}: IJCLA, ACM LAK2013
\end{itemize}
